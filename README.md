# What Drives Used Car Prices

## Overview
We analyzed thousands of used car listings to understand what factors really move prices up or down.  
The goal wasn’t just to predict numbers with a model, but to give you practical insights you can use when buying and pricing vehicles for your lot.

## What We Found
- **Age and mileage matter most.** Cars lose value quickly when they’re newer and rack up miles. The drop slows as cars get older.  
- **Condition is critical.** “Excellent,” “like new,” or “new” listings add thousands in value. “Fair” or “salvage” knocks prices down fast.  
- **Title status makes or breaks value.** Clean or lien titles add strong premiums, while missing or rebuilt titles drag prices down sharply.  
- **Body type, drive, and fuel all play roles.** Trucks, pickups, and offroad vehicles hold value better. 4WD and RWD usually price higher than FWD. Diesel models tend to bring in more money than gas or hybrid.

## Model Results
- The **Polynomial Regression** model gave us the most accurate predictions by capturing the curved effect of age and mileage.  
- Compared to a simple mileage-only model, error rates dropped by about **20–30%**, which means more reliable pricing anchors.  
- A **LASSO model** helped confirm which features really matter by shrinking weaker ones close to zero.

## What This Means for a Car Dealer
- **Focus on newer, low-mileage cars.** They’re predictable and easier to price right.  
- **Keep SUVs and trucks in stock.** These body types consistently bring higher returns.  
- **Avoid salvage/rebuilt titles unless deeply discounted.** The data shows they cut thousands off resale value.  
- **Check your local market for hybrids/EVs.** They can do well in some areas but lag in others.

## Next Steps
- Adding details like trim, accident history, and geography will make predictions even stronger.  
- Retraining the model regularly will help keep up with changing market conditions.

**Bottom line:** If you want reliable resale value, stick with **clean-title, newer SUVs and trucks in good condition**. These are your safest bets for both pricing and profit.
